Many traditional machine learning methods, such as Random Forests, Bagging, and Boosted Decision Trees, are built on the basis of Decision Trees. The concept is to display data as a tree, with each internal node denoting a test on an attribute (essentially a condition), each branch denoting the test's conclusion, and each leaf node (terminal node) holding a class label. <br>  
Decision trees are now widely used in many applications for predictive modeling, including both classification and regression.  CART, which stands for Classification and Regression Trees, is another name for decision trees. 


## Algorithm of a Decision Tree
The procedure for determining the class of a given dataset in a decision tree starts at the root node of the tree. This algorithm checks the values of the root attribute with the values of the record (actual dataset) attribute and then follows the branch and jumps to the next node based on the comparison.
