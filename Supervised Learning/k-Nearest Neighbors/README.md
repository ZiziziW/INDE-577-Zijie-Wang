## Introduction 
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a data classification method for estimating the likelihood that a data point will become a member of one group or another based on what group the data points nearest to it belong to. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used to solve classification and regression problems.

## part 1. parametric and non-parametric models
Finding a function approximation created from input or predictor variables and whose output represents the response variable is the goal of training machine learning models. It's named function approximation because there's always a difference between the value of the function output and the actual or real-world value. 

## Part2. Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn (previously scikits.learn, and also known as sklearn) is a free Python machine learning package. It includes support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN, among other classification, regression, and clustering techniques, and is designed to work with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. Scikit-learn is a financially supported NumFOCUS project.
